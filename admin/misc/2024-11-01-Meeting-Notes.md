Next Steps:

* Decide which direction we are going towards on followup in person meeting on *Monday 11/4/24 @ 2pm in the CSE building*  
  * Leaning towards tracker apps of different venues (calorie, fitness, etc.) for brownfield but can still branch out to different ideas  
  * Maybe greenfield \-  dashboard?   
  * We are open to either idea still and plan on seeking out TA advice  
* Visualize the problem  
  * Create sketches of the problem and put it into the github repo
