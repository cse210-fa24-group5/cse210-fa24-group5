Project Proposal

1. Clarity on Vision: Include a clear direction and timeline, all planned features, user stories, and personas.

Collective Journal idea (collectively test it)

Developer Productivity Tool \- Scheduling? Notes? 

**Central Problem/theme: help people be consistent with their plans / help people focus on tasks**

**Greenfield**

**Pomodoro Timer**\-

Simple

Add to-do list, being able to check it off

Add other people (stretch goal)

Problem we solve: Manage hobbies and goals directly, and set time for each of them. 

Help people focus and be consistent among plans. Make it a routine

**User story:** 

Someone wants to schedule time for all of their hobbies, and use the integrated pomodoro timer to make sure they are dedicating enough time for each of them. They can import their google calendar into it. “I want to spend 30 minutes of my day learning Spanish” We’re going to have the app send reminders to dedicate this amount of time daily to the goal that we had set in the app (learning Spanish)\`

2. Risk Assessment: Cover potential risks, rabbit holes, and research on similar products.

We could go on a rabbit hole trying to add more features. There is a similar project (TickTick) [https://ticktick.com/?language=en\_US](https://ticktick.com/?language=en_US)

Potential risk is difficulty with integrating Calendar API, getting bogged down with tech stack.

3. Design Prep: Present sketches, diagrams, stack choices, and a basic system design.

Project Setup: Please remember to follow these guidelines:

* a statement of purpose, user personas, risks, and visuals (sketches/wireframes).

Statement of Purpose: 

We want to design a productivity tool that users can use to designate goals and integrate their Google Calendar and use a pomodoro timer to dedicate time daily towards reaching their goals.

Design: We want to integrate Pomodoro Timer implementation from [https://github.com/arianimmen/Pomodoro-Timer-App](https://github.com/arianimmen/Pomodoro-Timer-App)

Use pomodoro timer as a base (?) but its not a main feature. [https://arianimmen.github.io/Pomodoro-Timer-App/public/index.html](https://arianimmen.github.io/Pomodoro-Timer-App/public/index.html)

* Set up your team’s repo on GitHub: cse210-fa24-group\<group-no\>, and add the pitch document under /specs/pitch.
