## Attendance
Today, Jakob, Harry, Ekko, and Jack attended in person, Cheryl and Shivani attended remote.

## Accomplished this Sprint
This sprint, we've been working on feature branches and have yet to merge them. However, each branch has very promising functionality

### Jakob
Jakob worked on the pipeline, adding code standards/styling into our pipeline, using eslint and prettier.
Helped Brian and Jack fix the testing pipeline

### Shivani
Shivani worked on the code for our original API calls to Leetcode for fetching completed problems, submissions in difficulties. 
Add style changes for the completed problems list, different colors for each difficulty, into its own corresponding CSS file

### Cheryl
Added a call to Leetcode API that fetched problem numbers for the problems we were already fetching
Added a proxy server that we could use to make Leetcode API calls. Original API code wasn't working from the actual extension

### Brian
### Jack
Brian and Jack worked on a timer. The timer is able to reset and hide the timer, and the timer automatically retrieves the difficulty and sets the countdown time based on the timer
Wrote tests for the timer as well, fixed part of the testing pipeline so that end 2 end tests run node, and unit tests run on JSDom. 

### Harry
### Ekko
Harry and Ekko worked on adding persisted tasks into the extension, locally adding todo-problems via the extension,
and having the extension read from browser events in order to capture "problem completed" events.
