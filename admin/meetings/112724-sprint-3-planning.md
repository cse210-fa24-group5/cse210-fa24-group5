## Sprint Planning

This sprint, we're focusing on consolidating the branches we've worked on last sprint. Mainly:

- pull Ekkos branch into dev
  - remove testing defaults/placeholder to-do list items
  - add some unit tests/integrations
- pull Timer branch into dev
  - Ekko's branch has a persistent db, we should use that db for timer settings/storing user preference
- pull css/styling from Shivani/Cheryl's branch into dev
  - restructure so its implemented on top of Ekko's logic
  - restyle ekkos extension to more closely match the figma diagrams
    - Create separate completed tasks page

 
- 2nd tier priority
  - Hijack leetcode page to create button that adds current problem to to-do list
  - Create timer settings page

In general, we should try to make smaller pull requests and push to dev mroe often to avoid conflicts

Chrome Web Store deployment costs 5 dollars, we might need to fundraise if we want to make it go live

- Retrium is 30 dollars so in comparison its not that bad :)
