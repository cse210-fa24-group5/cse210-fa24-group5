### Retro for sprint 2 meeting 11/25
- Used retrium to guide our retro meeting
- Work Happiness radar insight: this week's happiness radar is slightly smaller than last time's, it could be due to overlapping in our work
- Mad/Sad/Glad activity insights:
  - Leetcode API and webpage are hard to work with
    - If have time in the end, need to find more elegant solutions
  - Some of us are doing overlapping work, which is inefficient
    - Maybe need to have smaller issues
    - Maybe need clearer definition of tasks
  - Need more communication between pair-programming groups
  - We are overall satisfied with our work and pace
  - Meetings are generally shorter and more efficient
  - We have a good team dynamic
