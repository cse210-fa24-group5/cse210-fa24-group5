# {Chose Greenfield Project over Brownfield}

## Context and Problem Statement

{We had 2 options, greenfield (developer dashboard, developer journal, or developer productivity tool) and brownfield.}

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* {We wanted to make a tool that we would want to use as developers}
* {Journal Tool - We struggled to find ways to make the journal tool developer-focused and useful for us.}
* {Habit tracker tool - More focused on user habits and productivity}
* {Habit tracker tool - too much friction having to add tasks manually and open a new website }
* {LeetCode Tool - LeetCode doesn't have some features that we feel we need for learning (timer, to-do-list, etc.)}
* {LeetCode Tool - We wanted to create a tool that we personally would find useful as developers}


## Considered Options

* {We considered a journal at first because existing journals like Notion could use some developer oriented features.}
* {We considered a productivity tracker because students generally want tools to manage their time.}
* {We considered a LeetCode problem tracker tool because LeetCode solvers (AKA us)cannot create to do lists from the website, don't have a timer counting down either and we wanted to create something that we would find useful.}


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "LeetCode problem tracker tool", because it's a tool that is more likely to be helpful to our target user base (student developers) In contrast, our productivity tool didn't have a strong enough link to what developers would actually want or use.
